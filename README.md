Hello and welcome to my repo.

My name is Tyler White, I'm a Chicago native and lifelong fan of the Bears, Blackhawks and White Sox. Some fun facts- 1) I cycled in RAGBRAI a couple times which is a week-long bicycle ride across the entire state of Iowa, roughly 85 miles a day. 2) I enjoy sky diving and at one point was working towards a license. 3) Once participated in a marathon up the stairwell of the Sears tower (104 floors). 4) I worked as a butcher for 8 months just because I wanted to learn more about how to cut and prepare meat. I am a huge fan of smoking and grilling various meats.

I began my professional career in digital media, art and design, which I did for ~8 years. While I enjoyed the creative aspect, especially with photography and 3D art, I did not like the incredibly long hours and salary structure. After researching many different industries, I believe software development is more in-line with my career goals.
