Hello and welcome to my repo.

My name is Tyler White, I'm a Chicago native and lifelong fan of the Bears, Blackhawks and White Sox. 

I began my professional career in digital media, art and design, which I did for ~8 years. While I enjoyed the creative aspect, especially with photography and 3D art, I did not like the incredibly long hours and salary structure. After researching many different industries, I believe software development is more in-line with my career goals.
